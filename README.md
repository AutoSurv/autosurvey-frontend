# Autosurvey Project

## Introduction 
Project AutoSurvey aims to help NGO to retrieve data from different surveys and use them globally in an automated way reducing the time and resources needed. Having one standardized entry point for data collection increases the efficiency and itâ€™s less prone to human error due to field validation.
